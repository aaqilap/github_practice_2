## Andy's comments
I agree that the article is interesting because of how it covers vibe coding and its influence on the future of software development. Personally, I've seen and am curious about how vibe coding can affect other jobs. This past summer, I worked as a UX Designer and collaborated with UX Researchers and Product Managers. What I found surprising is that everyone was getting their hands on trying to vibe code out prototypes for the team to test, and even including the prototypes in user testing. Static design is slowly dying, and with vibe coding, there's no excuse to not communicate through prototypes anymore.
